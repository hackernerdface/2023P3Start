Our American universities offer students many silly 
courses that will prepare them to become professional geese . 
You can get a degree as a Bachelor of people or take a 
regular liberal flags course. Or, if you want to become 
a/an large engineer, you can study red mathematics 
and differential frogs . Then, after 47 years, if 
you want to continue your studies you can write a/an monkey and 
become a Doctor of bananas . 

When you get out into the very world, if you have a diploma 
from a university, you will be able to get a job easily as a/an janitor 
or even a/an Lawyer . If you don't have a diploma, you may have to take 
a job as a balls . 

Remember, it's important that you study hard in high school so you are able 
to do well on your college entrance books . It is true that "a little 
learning is a/an warm thing."
